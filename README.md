# **Determined**

**Overview:** Determined is a workout tracking program using a Flask backend and a React front end.</br>
**Motivation:** I went to the gym quite often before the we had to be locked down and some of the workout log apps I used didn't work quite the way I wanted so I thought I'd try to make one of my own. </br>
The exercise database being used is located at https://github.com/wrkout/exercises.json</br>
Determined repository is located at https://github.com/wonaval/determined </br>
Deployed at TBA
